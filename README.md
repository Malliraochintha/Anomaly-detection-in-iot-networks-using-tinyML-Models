# Anomaly-detection-in-iot-networks-using-tinyML-Models
This project explores anomaly detection in IoT using classic ML (RF, SVM, LR, NN) and TinyML models. Using the NSL-KDD dataset, we enable low-latency, on-device detection for resource-limited devices, aiming for scalable, power-efficient security in IoT environments.
